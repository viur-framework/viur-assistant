    and extended tags (like "de-DE-x-simple-language" for simplified German).

    Dictionary for defining style characteristics of translations.

    Each key represents a named translation style (e.g., "simple"), and its value
    is a list of stylistic rules or constraints that should be followed when generating
    a translation in that style.

    The special key "*" defines rules that are *always* applied in addition to any
    specific style. These are base-level constraints that apply globally, regardless of
    the selected style.

    Example:
    - The "simple" characteristic focuses on clarity and accessibility,
      encouraging short, active-voice sentences with simple vocabulary and structure.
    - The "*" characteristic enforces universally that the output must not be vulgar.

    This structure allows combining a base set of rules with additional style-specific ones.
